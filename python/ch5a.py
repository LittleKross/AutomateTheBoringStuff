# Chess Dictionary Validator
# In this chapter, we used the dictionary value {'1h': 'bking', '6c': 'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop', '5h': 'bqueen', '3e': 'wking'} to represent a chess board. Write a function
# named isValidChessBoard() that takes a dictionary argument and returns True or False depending on if the board is valid.

# A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be on a valid
# space from '1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'. The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent white or black, followed by 'pawn', 'knight',
# 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'. This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.
